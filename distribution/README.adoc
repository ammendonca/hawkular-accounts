= Hawkular Accounts - Distribution

This module builds a complete distribution of Hawkular Accounts, meaning, it assembles a Wildfly with Keycloak and
deploys the backend to it. No further configuration is required.

Note, however, that this module is not supported and is not an official way to run or consume Hawkular Accounts. This
module is meant only to provide a quick way to get up and running with the project. There might be discrepancies
between this and the official link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular/tree/master/kettle[Kettle] build. In such
cases, Kettle takes precedence.

Additionally, this module does *not* bundles the UI. Refer to the documentation of
link:https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-ui-components[hawkular-ui-components] to learn how to get up and running with
the UI.

== About the distribution

This distribution takes the Keycloak Appliance and builds on top of it. It applies some XSLT transformations to the
standalone.xml . Besides, the build generates UUIDs used for the application secrets.

== Setup

From the parent module:
[source,bash]
----
$ mvn clean install -Pdistribution
----

This will generate a Wildfly bundle with all the requirements on the distribution/target directory.
